1. Sign up for a Lyrebird account and get an API key. You'll need this to make requests to the Lyrebird API.
2. Integrate the Lyrebird API client library in your project. You have the option of using either:
	The JavaScript API client - If your project is a web app built with JavaScript.
	The Python API client - If your project is a Python app.
3. Collect a reference audio sample of the target speaker's voice that you want to mimic. This could be 10-30 seconds of audio.
4. Use the Lyrebird API to create a voice model from the reference audio. This step requires an API request. The response will contain a voice model ID.
5. Store the voice model ID and the API key. You'll need these to synthesize speech.
6. When the user types or speaks some text in your live app, make an API request to synthesize speech using that text and the voice model ID.
7. Play the synthesized audio response from the Lyrebird API to the user. This will sound like the target speaker mimicking what the user said.
8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 to synthesize and play new speech in real-time as the user provides new input text.
