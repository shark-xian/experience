Here are some examples of tools that can be used to create deepfake content:

• FaceSwap - This is a free and open source tool for face swapping and face reenactment. It uses neural networks to map the facial expressions from one face to another.
• DeepFaceLab - Another free and open source tool for face swapping and face reenactment. It has a more advanced model and UI compared to FaceSwap. 
• Faceshift - A commercial solution from Final Frame that enables realistic 3D face animation and face swapping in real time.
• Lyrebird - An AI voice cloning API that can be used to synthesize speech and mimic anyone's voice. It has an SDK for developers.
• UberSpeech - Another voice cloning solution that uses neural networks to mimic a target speaker's voice given a short audio sample. 
• Voicemod - A voice modulation app that includes voice cloning features. It allows altering the user's voice in real time.
• FakeApp - A web-based tool for creating fake videos and deepfakes. It uses machine learning to replicate head poses, mouth movements and eye blinks.
• DeepVidCut - An open source tool for creating deepfakes by swapping faces in videos. It uses a GAN model for face reenactment.

These are just some examples of tools that leverage techniques like face swapping, face reenactment, and voice cloning to create deepfake content. Some are free and open source while others are commercial products. They vary in ease of use, model sophistication and the type of deepfake media they can generate.

- FaceSwap: This tool is written primarily in Python using OpenCV for computer vision tasks. 
- DeepFaceLab: This tool also uses Python as its main programming language along with OpenCV.
- Faceshift: While Faceshift is a commercial product, they do provide an SDK for developers which is based on Python.
- Lyrebird: The Lyrebird API has SDKs for multiple languages, including Python. So their voice cloning technology can be accessed from Python code.
- UberSpeech: UberSpeech provides a Python SDK for developers to integrate their voice cloning models.
- Voicemod: Though Voicemod is mainly an app, they do have a Python SDK for their voice modulation and voice cloning features.
- FakeApp: FakeApp's web interface is JavaScript based, but their deepfake model training is done using Python.
- DeepVidCut: This open source tool is written entirely in Python using OpenCV for computer vision tasks.

In summary, yes all of the deepfake tools I mentioned previously - FaceSwap, DeepFaceLab, Faceshift, Lyrebird, UberSpeech, Voicemod, FakeApp and DeepVidCut - do leverage Python to varying extents, whether as their primary programming language, an SDK for developers, or for model training.

This is because of the reasons I outlined in my previous answer - Python's rich machine learning and scientific computing ecosystem makes it ideal for building deepfake tools.

Some of the deepfake tools that can alter the speaker's voice and likeness are:

• Lyrebird - This AI voice cloning API can synthesize speech that mimics a target speaker's voice. It can alter both the voice and the words spoken.

• UberSpeech - Another voice cloning tool that can generate speech in a target speaker's voice given a short audio sample of that person. 

• Voicemod - This voice modulation app includes voice cloning features that can alter both the voice and the spoken words.

• Faceshift - This commercial 3D face animation and face swapping solution can alter both the face and the voice of the speaker in real time. 

• FakeApp - This web-based tool can create deepfake videos by swapping faces and voices. It uses machine learning to generate realistic lip syncing and facial expressions.

• DeepFaceLab - This open source face swapping and reenactment tool can generate deepfakes where both the face and voice of the speaker are altered.

• Face2Face - A research project from Stanford University that enables real-time facial reenactment and voice mimicry to create convincing deepfakes.

In summary, many of the deepfake tools focus on either voice cloning/alteration or face swapping/reenactment. But some of the more advanced ones, like Faceshift, FakeApp, DeepFaceLab and Face2Face can alter both the voice and face of the speaker to generate realistic deepfake content where the speaker's likeness and voice are not their own.

Hope this list of deepfake tools that can alter both the voice and likeness of the speaker helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
