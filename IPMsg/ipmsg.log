   - **Guest Blogging**: Contribute to reputable sites in your niche.

3. **Technical SEO**:
   - **SSL Certificate**: Use HTTPS for security and trust.
   - **XML Sitemap**: Submit to search engines to help them crawl your site.
   - **Robots.txt**: Direct search engines on what pages to crawl or ignore.
   - **301 Redirects**: Ensure old URLs are redirected to maintain link equity.

   - **Fix 404 Errors**: Regularly check and fix broken links.

4. **Infrastructure**:

our coverletter is interesting. You state that you have extensive experience. Have you worked with any Open Source Large Language models? I have not decided if I want to integrate with something like ChatGPT 3.5, PaLM2, or Claude2 for the chat, Google Cloud for the Speech to Text and then something like Eleven Labs for the Text to speech. The biggest issues I am having right now is figuring out how to best handle a live conversation with customers via AI.



The AI needs to be intelligent but restrained. I dont want people calling and talking to it about things other than placing orders or asking for directions to the restaurant. I want it to forward the call to a person if it deems it is incapable of answering the questions a customer might be asking, and doing so without it being obvious to the customer that they are talking to a machine.



Considering that, I have thought about creating a large library of common responses to make responding fast, but I need the AI to determine if the library has a sufficient response and if it doesnt have it respond in a way similar to "let me check, real quick." and have that give it time to generate a new audio response.



I will need some kind of DB integration so that there is a way to collect and track restaurant info such as menus and ingredients and keep them cached and quickly available for retrieval by the AI. I also need the AI to be smart enough to understand various mispronouciations of the work Gnocchi.



A strong live conversational bot as a huge amount of potential for any business needing to take orders.



I also need appropriate order scheduling to be done and updated as the ordered items are entered into the POS. I am not sure if this level of integration exists via API yet or not so some creative thinking in this area will be needed.

Henry Brill 9:08 PM
Thanks for your attention.

To handle a live conversation with Customers via AI, there are some steps are needed.
Like Design a conversational flow, implement intent recognition and integrate fallback mechanisms.

JC
Jared Cluff 9:26 PM
Agreed. I have been thinking through some ideas to record responses as customers communicate for review later and if approved, get integrated into a library of responses based on tone and content so that the actual responses can be much faster than having to have an AI always to STT. STT would only be for respones that doent exist in the library yet.

Henry Brill 9:41 PM
Great thinking. select an appropriate response based on the tone and content of the customer's query.

I'm sorry to hear that your WhatsApp account has been suspended. This can happen for various reasons, such as using an unofficial version of WhatsApp, scraping user information, or violating the Terms of Service. If you think your account has been suspended by mistake, you can appeal to WhatsApp by following these steps:

Open WhatsApp and tap on Request a review in the app. You will be prompted to enter a 6-digit registration code sent to you via SMS.Once you enter it, you can submit your request for a review and add details to support your case. https://faq.whatsapp.com/465883178708358Alternatively, you can email WhatsApp at support@whatsapp.com and explain why you think your account has been suspended in error.You should include your phone number in full international format and any relevant information or evidence that can help your case. https://www.india.com/technology/whatsapp-banned-heres-how-you-can-recover-your-suspended-account-5127701/Wait for WhatsApp to review your request and get back to you. This may take some time depending on the volume of requests they receive.You should receive an email or an in-app message with the outcome of your appeal. https://faq.whatsapp.com/465883178708358
If your appeal is successful, WhatsApp will remove the ban from your account and you will be able to use it again. However, if your appeal is unsuccessful or you continue to violate the Terms of Service, WhatsApp may permanently ban your account from using their service. Therefore, it is important that you read and follow the Acceptable Use of Our Services section of their Terms of Service to avoid future suspensions. https://faq.whatsapp.com/465883178708358 https://faq.whatsapp.com/1297640017664693

I hope this helps you understand how to appeal for your WhatsApp account suspension. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask me. blush

An essential part of running a successful AI business is having a solid technology plan. This plan outlines how you will leverage technology to support your operations, enhance efficiency, and deliver AI solutions to customers. Here are the key components to consider when developing a technology plan for an AI business:

Infrastructure
The foundational technology infrastructure is critical for an AI business. You will need:

Reliable hosting: Select hosting providers that can scale to meet your demands and provide high uptime. Cloud hosting is often ideal for AI workloads.

Secure cloud storage: Store data and train AI models in secure cloud storage solutions like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

High-speed connectivity: Ensure fast internet speeds to handle large data transfers and training of AI models.

Software and Tools
Identify the right software and tools to support your AI development work:

AI development tools: Use frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch and tools like Jupyter Notebooks for AI model development.

Data annotation tools: If training your own AI models, you will likely need tools to annotate and label large datasets.

Version control: Use version control systems like Git to manage your AI codebase.

Project management: Adopt project management software to coordinate work across your team.

Security Measures
Prioritize security at every layer of your infrastructure:

Encrypt data: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using technologies like SSL/TLS.

Secure access: Implement multi-factor authentication and access controls for systems and data.

Monitor for threats: Use security monitoring tools to detect threats and anomalies.

Audit regularly: Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests.

Integration and Automation
Leverage integration and automation to improve efficiency:

API integration: Expose your AI solutions as APIs to integrate with other systems.

Workflow automation: Automate repetitive tasks using tools like Zapier or IFTTT.

AI for automation: Use AI to identify patterns and automate more complex processes.

Continuous Improvement
Adopt a culture of continuous improvement:

Monitor performance metrics: Track metrics like model accuracy, data processing times, etc.

Seek feedback: Get feedback from customers, partners and your team on ways to improve systems and processes.

Evaluate new technologies: Stay up to date on the latest AI advancements and evaluate how they could benefit your business.

In summary, a strong technology plan that incorporates the right infrastructure, tools, security measures, integrations, and culture of improvement will be foundational for the success of your AI business. I hope this overview of the key components helps get you started! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Sure, here are more details about each step for implementing multi-tenancy with Wagtail as a decoupled microservice:

1. Configure communication: You will need to set up a communication mechanism between your main application and the Wagtail microservice. This can be done through APIs or message queues to exchange data and requests. You can define a clear API contract and use RESTful APIs or GraphQL to communicate between the two services. Alternatively, you can use message brokers like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka to exchange messages between the services.

2. Implement multi-tenancy logic: Within the Wagtail microservice, you can use the `wagtail-tenants` package or customize your code to handle multi-tenancy. This includes managing tenant-specific data, URL routing, templates, and any other necessary functionality. You can use a shared database with a tenant identifier column or separate databases for each tenant. Use middleware or context processors to inject the tenant identifier into the request object and customize the Wagtail settings to include tenant-specific settings.

3. Define data segregation: Ensure that tenant-specific data within the Wagtail microservice is properly segregated. This can be achieved by associating each content item with its respective tenant identifier. Use Django's built-in permission system to control access to data and enforce data access restrictions based on tenant ownership.

4. Secure communication: Implement appropriate security measures for communication between the main application and the Wagtail microservice. This may involve authentication, authorization, and encryption to protect sensitive data. Use secure communication protocols like HTTPS and ensure that APIs are protected by API keys or OAuth tokens.

5. Test and deploy: Thoroughly test the multi-tenancy implementation to ensure that each tenant can access and manage their own content within the decoupled Wagtail microservice. Deploy the changes to your production environment once testing is successful. Monitor the system for performance and security issues and make necessary adjustments as needed.

Remember to follow best practices for microservices architecture, such as loose coupling, high cohesion, and fault tolerance. By decoupling Wagtail as a microservice, you can achieve better scalability, maintainability, and flexibility in your application architecture.

-------------------------------------
 Here are the steps to implement a multi-tenant Wagtail CMS on your localhost:

1. Install Wagtail:
`pip install wagtail`

2. Create a Django project:
`django-admin startproject multitenant`

3. Install Wagtail into the project:
`python manage.py wagtail start`

4. Create a Tenant model:

```python
from django.db import models

class Tenant(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)  
    # ... other fields
```

5. Add a tenant foreign key to Wagtail models:

```python 
from django.db import models

class BlogPage(Page):
    tenant = models.ForeignKey(Tenant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    # ... other fields  
```

6. Isolate databases: Use schema separation in a single Postgres database. Add a tenant_id to the database router:

```python
class TenantRouter: 
   def db_for_read(self, model, **hints):
       if model._meta.app_label == 'wagtailcore':
           return model.tenant.database_name
       return None
```

7. Customize the Wagtail admin:

- Only show pages for the current tenant  
- Add a tenant switcher 
- Hide/show menu items  

8. Isolate media: Save files in `media/tenant_<id>/`

9. Validate input belongs to the current tenant.

10. Test thoroughly across multiple tenants.

11. Runserver:
`python manage.py runserver`

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions about implementing a multi-tenant Wagtail CMS.

-------------------------------------
The task you've mentioned revolves around building a model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), which is a technology that converts spoken language into written text. Typical ASR systems involve developing a deep learning model for transcribing speech.

1. **Collect the Data**: Since you already have audio files and their text transcripts from about 150 speakers, you can use them for modeling. The dataset should be clean and the transcripts should be perfectly aligned with the audio. 
2. **Preprocess the Data**: The audio files should be preprocessed to ensure they are in the same format and quality. Noise reduction might also be needed to improve the model's accuracy.
3. **Choose Your Model**: There are many established models for speech recognition like DeepSpeech (by Mozilla), Wav2Vec 2.0 (by Facebook AI), or Google's Speech-to-Text API. Depending on your resources and expertise, you can choose to use pre-built models or develop your own model.
Choosing the "best" model for speech recognition depends on multiple factors including the problem you're trying to solve, the amount of labeled data you have, computational resources, and whether you need real-time processing or not. However, here are some commonly used and well-regarded techniques and models for speech recognition tasks:

1. **DeepSpeech by Mozilla**: It's a speech-to-text (STT) engine that uses a model trained by machine learning techniques, based on Baidu's Deep Speech research paper. Mozilla has released pre-trained models for English which work reasonably well for other languages too.
2. **Wav2Letter by Facebook's FAIR (Facebook AI Research)**: It's a Speech-to-Text system which implements a neural network architecture based on convolutional neural networks for acoustic modeling. The input to the system is raw audio and the output is the transcription of the audio.
3. **Wav2Vec 2.0 by Facebook AI Research**: It's the latest model from Facebook and offers state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. It uses a deep-learning based approach that builds and refines an initial base model into progressively better ones by self-supervised learning.
4. **Google's Speech-To-Text API**: This is a cloud-based API which is very powerful and supports multiple languages. It's not a model or a framework you can train on your own data like the previous options, but it's an online service you can use to transcribe audio.
5. **Kaldi**: It's an open-source toolkit for speech recognition that is quite popular for its versatility and flexibility. It's harder to get started with due to its complexity but is used extensively in academia and industry.
6. **ESPnet**: It's an end-to-end speech processing toolkit developed by many collaborators, mainly from academia. It uses PyTorch and TensorFlow and includes pre-trained models.

4. **Train Your Model**: Feed the audio files and the transcripts through your chosen model. The model will learn to map the audio files to the correct transcripts.
5. **Evaluate and Fine-tune Your Model**: After the initial model is trained, you'll need to assess its performance and adjust hyperparameters or use techniques like transfer learning to optimize the model. 
6. **Testing the Model**: The final step is to test model predictions on unseen data to see how accurately it transcribes speech from the same speakers.

Note: Ensuring "100% recognition" is generally unrealistic in machine learning, as all models have limitations and error rates. A more realistic goal is to reach the highest accuracy possible with your available resources.

Also, while it's possible to train your model with separate speakers, building a speaker-independent ASR system will be more robust and versatile.

Honorable President of India, Honorable Vice President, Honorable Speaker, Lok Sabha, Deputy Chairman Rajya Sabha, Governor, State of Gujarat, Chief Minister, State of Gujarat, Parliamentary Affairs Minister, all other distinguished guests and dignitaries, I do not know how shall I express my joy, exhilaration, and rejoicing moment, because this is the first time ever in my life I am witnessing this kind of conference under the template, All India Presiding Officers Conference. So in the inception I must express my gratitude to the host of this program who are generous enough to invite me to be discovered myself in the presence of the galaxy of luminaries, eminent persons across the nation. You are going to celebrate the auspicious and historic occasion, Constitution Day, in Kapadia, which is also witnessing the tallest statue in the world dedicated to the memory of Iron Man, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patil, who espoused the concept of rise above caste, region, and religion, who had weaved the nation, who had played an instrumental role in political and national integration of our country, India. It is a land blessed by the soul of Mahatma Gandhi also. As we know that India is a young nation as well as an ancient civilization. Our constitution was a great contribution of those freedom fighters, of those eminent persons who represented each and every walk of our life and who had staged every night, who had exhausted all their resources, who had burned their midnight oil to prepare the great manuscript in the world, the longest written constitution, the architect Babasaheb Ambedkar, who exhorted to the nation that only political democracy is not sufficient for the country. We need social democracy also, which recognizes liberty, equality, and fraternity. Liberty cannot be divorced from equality, equality cannot be divorced from liberty, and equality and liberty both cannot be divorced from fraternity. The civilization of our nation has been reflected in the preparation of the constitution. The Indian civilization has never indulged in any kind of singular idea in terms of our metaphysics, philosophy, religion. In every sphere, in every realm, Indian civilization has reflected the idea of plurality. Plurality should be the basic feature of our civilization. Plurality is a concept that accommodates differences. Differences embody and enact a descent. So, India believes in the concept of plurality. India is an augmentative society, and our civilizational conventions always recognize that convention of debate, dialogue, descent, disagreement. This is the country, as I said earlier, blessed by the great soul Mahatma Gandhi, who was the epitome of truth and nonviolence, who was recognized throughout the world as an emancipator of the oppressed people of the world. I just cite a short narration on Mahatma Gandhi before concluding my speech. When the entire Europe was ravaged by the fascist forces during the course of World War II, Einstein was driven away from Europe. Nobel laureate Thomas Mann's books were burned down. At that time, poet Rabindranath Tagore expressed his anguish, pain and grief to his friends and associates. One of his friends replied him that, I already share the anguish with you, but at the same time I will remind you, poet Rabindranath Tagore, that the civilization of the world has never been determined by the brutal forces. The civilization of the world has been determined by the forces of humanity. So, neither the brown shirt of Hitler, nor the black shirt of Mussolini will determine the course of the civilization. Rather, the course of the civilization is going to be determined by such a person who does not have any shirt. He is Mahatma Gandhi, he lives in our country and Gujarat is the abode of the great person Mahatma Gandhi. Long live Indian constitution, long live Indian democracy, long live India. Thank you.

At that time, poet Rabindranath Tagore expressed his anguish, pain and grief to his friends and associates. One of his friends replied to him, that I also share the anguish with you, but at the same time, I will remind you, poet Rabindranath Tagore, that the civilizations of the world have never been determined by the brutal forces. The civilization of the world has been determined by the forces of humanity. So neither the brown shirt of Hitler, nor the black shirt of Mussolini will determine the course of the civilization. Rather, the course of the civilization is going to be determined by such a person who does not have any shirt. He is Mahatma Gandhi. He lives in our country, and Gujarat is the abode of the great person Mahatma Gandhi. Long live Indian Constitution. Long live Indian democracy. Long live India. Thank you.

 Here are the steps to change the Wagtail logo on the admin page:

1. Create a custom `wagtailadmin` template folder. For example:

```
custom_wagtailadmin/
    templates/
        wagtailadmin/
```

2. Copy the `base.html` template from the Wagtail installation into your custom template folder:

```
cp /path/to/wagtail/wagtailadmin/templates/wagtailadmin/base.html custom_wagtailadmin/templates/wagtailadmin/
```

3. In your custom `base.html` template, update the logo HTML:

```html
<div id="header">
    <a href="{% url 'wagtailadmin_home' %}"><img src="{% static 'my-logo.svg' %}" alt="My Site Name" /></a>
</div>
```

Here we are pointing the `<img>` tag to a custom logo `my-logo.svg` in your static files.

4. Tell Wagtail to use your custom template folder by updating the `TEMPLATES` setting:

```python
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [custom_wagtailadmin/templates],
        ...
    }
]
```

5. Rebuild your Django template cache for the changes to take effect.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
