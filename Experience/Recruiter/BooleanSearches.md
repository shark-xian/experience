## Boolean Searches
Boolean searches are a type of search that uses Boolean operators, such as **AND, OR, and NOT**, to combine keywords and search terms. Boolean operators allow you to narrow or broaden your search results, depending on your needs.

**AND**

The AND operator is used to combine two or more keywords or search terms. When you use AND, all of the keywords or search terms must be present in the search results.

For example, if you search for "dog AND cat", your search results will only include pages that contain both the words "dog" and "cat".

**OR**

The OR operator is used to combine two or more keywords or search terms. When you use OR, only one of the keywords or search terms needs to be present in the search results.

For example, if you search for "dog OR cat", your search results will include pages that contain either the word "dog" or the word "cat", or both.

**NOT**

The NOT operator is used to exclude a keyword or search term from the search results. When you use NOT, the keyword or search term must not be present in the search results.

For example, if you search for "dog NOT cat", your search results will only include pages that contain the word "dog" and do not contain the word "cat".

Boolean searches can be used to create more precise and relevant search results. For example, if you are researching a specific topic, you can use Boolean operators to combine keywords and search terms to find information that is relevant to your research.

Here are some examples of Boolean searches:

* "dog AND cat food"
* "software engineer OR computer scientist"
* "artificial intelligence NOT machine learning"
* "product manager AND experience with SaaS"
* "marketing campaign AND social media"

You can use Boolean operators in any search engine, including Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. To use Boolean operators, simply type them between your keywords and search terms.
